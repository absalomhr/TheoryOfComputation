This programs were implemented as excersises in the class Computational Theory.

To execute them you can run GENERAL.py, from there everything is on a menu.
The results of all the computations made by the programms are stored in files.
These programs were suggested by Dr. Genaro Juarez MartÃ­nez.

Here I give a brief explanation of what each programm does:

1. WEBAY.py
This program reads a text (file or manually typed) and finds the strings "web" and "ebay".
It also finds the position where they were found. All of of this through a deterministic
automaton. It can also show a visualization of the automaton made with Tkinter.

2. REGEX.py
This program has preloaded two regular expressions from which it will generate 5 strings.

3. CHESS.py
This program calculates all the possible routes on a 3x3 chessboard starting in the first
square to the last (a -> i). It receives a string of colors of the squares (W = white,
R = red) and finds all the routes that match those colors, then if there is at least one
route that goes from square a to square i, it will show the animation of the route.

Try it with the following input for a better understandig of the programm:
"WW"

All the results are stored in files for further reading (All routes and "winning routes",
meaning routes that go from square a to square i.

4. PALINDROME.py
This program generates a binary palindrome of random or user-given lenght following
certain production rules.

5. PDA
This programm is a stack automaton. It will determine whether the input string has "n" 0's
followed by "n" 1's. It produces the animation of the automaton storing and retrieving
values from the stack.
